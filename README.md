# My_Ecommerce
 This simple ecommerce project was made to train programming in C# and Angular


I made this project to simply train, it is not to be put into production, because as I did it alone and I am a beginner, it may have several security flaws.

It runs together with a Sql server database, the Database connection string is defined in the Api's Web.config,
the tables are automatically created when starting the application or running the unit tests
